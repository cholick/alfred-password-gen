## alfred-password-gen
This workflow adds memorable password generation with the keyword `password`.

The `password` keyword can optionally be followed by a number ranging 10-25 to control password length. The
default is 15.

Selecting a password adds it to the clipboard.

### Installation
Download the newest version via [the latest release](https://github.com/cholick/alfred-password-gen/releases/latest)

### Why?
Using a password manager, most passwords should just be completely random. A memorable algorith is useful in situations like
* WiFi (sharing or entry on devices)
* Netflix (to more readily type it into the TV)
* Something that needs memorization (a device login)

### Notes
* The dictionary likely still has several offensive or triggering words: I did a quick pass through to remove
some, but I'm sure I missed many.
* [12Dicts](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/) is the source dictionary.
* [dictionary/process.py](dictionary/process.py) takes [dictionary/2of12inf.txt](dictionary/2of12inf.txt) and produces [dictionary/processed.py](dictionary/processed.py) after doing some cleanup. This only needs running again if the source words change.
